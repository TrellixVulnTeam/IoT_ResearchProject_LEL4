  abstract = {This document presents the new model of distributed consumers of electricity powering - named Power Modes. There is presented a conceptual model of an IT hierarchical distributed system for data acquisition and evidence the state of the controlled distributed object - the electric energy consumption. The authors will try to show that the proposed model of the IT system is accurate to solve the problem of the electric energy consumption management. In this context the proposed solutions are written into the DSM methods of power system balancing [1]. The competency of the paper is the presentation of the prototype system of intelligent metering which is developed and claimed for a patent protection [2], [3].}
