Development}\label{humankind-technology-development}}

Since the inception of the first home computers in the late 1970's
(Press, 1993), modern society has become utterly dependent on and
indeed, inexorably bound to digital technology. The rapid and widespread
adoption of computational technology has led to the fastest rate of
societal and economic development our species has ever experienced. One
of the most salient manifestations of technical progress has been the
widespread availability and adoption of Information and Communications
Technology (ICT), including the rise of the global network of networks
known as the Internet.

\hypertarget{the-rise-and-rise-of-the-world-wide-web}{%
\subsubsection{The Rise and Rise of the World Wide
Web}\label{the-rise-and-rise-of-the-world-wide-web}}

According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2015 ICTs
figures, Internet penetration has grown from just over 400 millions
users (6 per cent of global population) in 2000 to 3.2 billion users in
2015 (43 per cent of global population), which includes around 2 billion
users from developing countries (Dutta et al., 2015). ICTs bring a broad
range of benefits and are recognised as a key to eradicating poverty and
unemployment. They enable and facilitate the building a people-centred,
inclusive and development-oriented Information Society, where everyone
can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge. This
enables individuals, communities and peoples to achieve their full
potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their
quality of life (``Information and communication technologies (ICTs)
\textbar{} Poverty Eradication,'' n.d.). In addition to a rapidly
growing internet user-base both in the developing and developed world,
the nature of internet usage has fundamentally changed. Once the purview
of academics, engineers and computer scientists sending tiny packets of
information back and forth, there are now some 2.5 quintillion bytes of
data created each day by all manner of users, industry and sensors to
name a few (``Data Never Sleeps 5.0 \textbar{} Domo,'' n.d.).

\hypertarget{forging-a-new-technological-paradigm}{%
\subsubsection{Forging a New Technological
Paradigm}\label{forging-a-new-technological-paradigm}}

Such rapid and widespread internet adoption has created a seemingly
insatiable demand for exponentially greater computational power and
digital storage capacity. This has led to a new and utterly ubiquitous
technological paradigm; Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing is succinctly
defined as; The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on
the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local
server or a personal computer
(\url{https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cloud-computing}).

As with the initial rise and widespread implementation of the internet,
Cloud Computing itself acts as a facilitator for new technologies. One
such example being the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The Internet
of Things can be surmised as the extension of the Internet and the Web
into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment of
spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing
and/or actuation capabilities (Daniele Miorandi, 2012). The Internet of
Things (IoT) paradigm enables physical devices to connect and exchange
information, and also allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely
through the internet (Bing Huang, 2018). IoT devices allow objects to be
sensed or controlled remotely through the Internet (Luigi Atzori, 2010).
IoT thus represents a convergence of real-world objects and digital
objects into a unified cyber-physical system.

\hypertarget{the-bigger-picture}{%
\subsubsection{The Bigger Picture}\label{the-bigger-picture}}

Considering the bigger picture of societal benefit, as seen in figure
\ref{fig:globalPovertyPlot}, from 1990 through 2015 the number of people
living in extreme poverty has dropped by more than half. As evidenced by
Figure \ref{fig:internetAccessPlot}, over the same time period, the
percentage of people with access to the internet has move from around 1
per cent to an average of around 50 per cent (this trend is now moving
exponentially as a function of time). And, figure
\ref{fig:populationGrowthPlot} shows that over the last 100 years, the
human population has experienced unprecedented growth from 1 billion
individuals to in excess of 7 billion. Mankind have thus simultaneously
increased our population, increased of technological development and
decreased poverty (to name but a few, `key performance indicators').

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{MD_Final_files/figure-latex/populationGrowthPlot-1} 

}

\caption{ADD TEXT, Source: The World Bank, World Development Indicators}\label{fig:populationGrowthPlot}
\end{figure}

The success of modern human society is not without consequence. All of
the benefits our society has enjoyed from the development, production
and deployment of technology, has required vast amounts of energy. This
energy has, since the industrial revolution, primarily been derived from
the burning of fossil fuels, as illustrated by Figure
\ref{fig:globalEnergyPlot}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{MD_Final_files/figure-latex/globalEnergyPlot-1} 

}

\caption{ADD TEXT, Source: Our World in Data}\label{fig:globalEnergyPlot}
\end{figure}

The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds that Human
activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global
warming above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to
1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if
it continues to increase at the current rate (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, 2018).

Climate change poses an existential threat to modern human civilisation,
with warming of between 1.5°C and 2°C predicted to cause increases in
mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, hot extremes in most
inhabited regions, heavy precipitation changes including drought and
precipitation deficits in some regions. Additionally, increases in ocean
temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and
decreases in ocean oxygen levels are projected to reduce risks to marine
biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and
services to humans. Taken together, these effects will lead to risks of
the health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security,
and economic growth of mankind (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, 2018 - OTHER REF?).

\end{figure}

It is therefore imperative moving forward as a species that all steps
are be taken to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases and abate the
advance of anthropomorphic climate change. The scale of the challenge is
such that technology itself will prove critical in effectively combating
this existential threat to civilisation. When considering energy
consumption, the industrial sector (including the non-combusted use of
fuels) currently consumes around half of all global energy and feedstock
fuels, with residential and commercial buildings (29\%) and transport
(21\%) accounting for the remainder
(\url{https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/energy-outlook/demand-by-sector.html}).

\subsubsection{Optimising Global Energy
Usage}\label{optimising-global-energy-usage}}

Thus far, our staggering global achievements, including lifting hundreds
of millions out of poverty, rapid global technological deployment and
strong population growth has been inexorably linked to increased energy
consumption. This in turn has led to perturbations in atmospheric
chemistry, in the form of anthropogenic climate change (amongst many
other environmental challenges), which fundamentally threatens our
global achievements. It therefore stands that the key to continued human
prosperity is to de-couple growth in energy demand from economic growth.
In this work we will explore the possibility of reducing energy
consumption via the optimization of services to end users in an IoT
Smart Home.

\hypertarget{the-iot-smart-home-service-oriented-computing}{%
\subsubsection{The IoT Smart Home \& Service Oriented
Computing}\label{the-iot-smart-home-service-oriented-computing}}

As mentioned above, residential and commercial buildings account for
29\% of energy demand globally (REF). In this work we propose that an
avenue for reduced energy consumption is the optimization of existing
services and utilities to end users in an IoT Smart Home. In this
proposed smart home, the daily activities of the end user can be
performed with the support of a personalised artificial intelligence
(AI) system, such that the timing and manner of energy intensive
activities is optimised to reduce overall energy consumption, whilst
still considering the level of convenience afforded to the end user.
This work uses sensor data analogous to what would be expected to be
produced from a sensor rich IoT smart home and considers the interplay
between end user convenience; predictive analytics; predictive service
offering; energy consumption; demand response and smart electricity
grids.

Significant growth in digital interconnectivity over the last 20 years
has given the internet a pivotal role as an essential element of
economic growth (Haseeb et al., 2019). Cloud computing and the IoT
paradigm has enabled the association of previously disparate fields into
a larger coherent framework. Namely, smart home appliances,
demand-response, energy consumption, predictive analytics predictive
service offering and end user convenience. This work proposes a

The International Telecommunication Union estimated about 3.2 billion
people, or almost half of the world's population, would be online by the
end of the 2015 (``Information and communication technologies (ICTs)
\textbar{} Poverty Eradication,'' n.d.). The impact of ICTs (i.e.,
internet usage and mobile cellular subscriptions), globalization,
electricity consumption, financial development, and economic growth on
environmental quality has been examined (Haseeb et al., 2019). By using
1994--2014 panel data of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China \& South
Africa) economies, empirical results demonstrate that rise in both
internet usage and mobile cellular subscription (ICTs) likely mitigates
CO2 emissions in BRICS economies.

\textbf{BRIDGE} -- Greater internet availability / connectivity
facilitates the deployment of smart electricity grids

\hypertarget{smart-metering}{%
\subsubsection{Smart Metering}\label{smart-metering}}

A Smart meter is an electronic device that records consumption of
electric energy and communicates the information to the electricity
supplier for monitoring and billing. In the Unites States (for example)
smart meters are a significant part of the larger Smart Grid
infrastructure, and as far back as 2012, had been installed in over 25
million U.S. homes (Horne et al., 2015). Smart Meters transmit
information about consumer electricity use to utility companies at
vastly shorter time intervals than before and this information helps
utility companies to coordinate power supply and demand, detect outages,
implement time-of-use and dynamic pricing, and in other ways improve
system efficiency and reliability. Additionally, these data are also
becoming increasingly available, and sought-after, by end-users
themselves. Indeed, the main purpose of provisioning smart metering data
to end users is to encourage the use of less electricity, by better
informing users of their consumption patterns (Jui-Sheng Chou, 2019). In
the aggregate, these savings can significantly reduce national energy
use and curb energy emissions while addressing pressing geopolitical and
environmental concerns related to energy security and sustainability
(Graab, 2011).

Since the widespread deployment of smart meter technology, there has
been huge interest in the capability of these technologies with respect
to the technical capacity of utility companies to manage demand (through
demand response programs), incorporate renewable sources of electricity
into the system, and increase the overall efficiency and reliability of
the system (Horne et al., 2015). \textbf{It is worth noting, however,
that the scenario described above relies on end user intervention.}

\hypertarget{electricity-demand-response-smart-electricity-grids-and-smart-home-data}{%
\subsubsection{Electricity Demand Response, Smart Electricity Grids and
Smart Home
Data}\label{electricity-demand-response-smart-electricity-grids-and-smart-home-data}}

Predicting and influencing residential energy use has been the subject
to extensive study (\textbf{REF}). Literature indicates that factors
such as occupant behaviour and socio-economic status are important
\textbf{{[}15 from Cetin{]}}. Nielsen attributed 36\% of variation in
energy consumption of homes to lifestyle and occupant behaviour, and
64\% to socio-economic influences. This is exemplified by the work of De
et al, who show that in developing nations, cooking consumes up to 90\%
of the overall residential energy consumption and is mainly based on
non-renewable energy (International Energy Agency, 2006; De et al.,
2013). Other factors such as climate zone, number of occupants, income
level, age of home, and size of home have also been correlated with home
energy use (K.S. Cetin, 2014). The has been much work both on using
smart meter data to evaluate consumer behaviour, and the interplay
between smart appliances and shifting households' electricity demand.

Kavousian et al identify the need for developing an analytical method
that can leverage 15-minute or 30-minute interval energy consumption
data produced via smart metering in order to improve the effectiveness
of energy efficiency programs. They note that utilities spend millions
of dollars annually to improve appliance energy efficiency. By way of
example, in 2013 utilities in California US spent \$80 M USD on
appliance and plug load efficiency programs, the highest expenditure
among all utility energy efficiency programs (\textbf{CPUC, 2013 FIND
REF}). A need for analytical methodologies that can process smart meter
data and allow energy reduction savings to be identified is
demonstrated. Using a smart meter dataset of 4231 households, containing
information on electricity consumption at 30-minute intervals, with
aggregated local weather data, the authors use smart meter data to rank
residential appliance efficiency. Various control methodologies are
embedded into the analytical process, taking into account building type,
building size (e.g., apartment, detached), household type (e.g., de
facto, single, dependents), respondent age and heater type (e.g.,
electric or gas). The data set included 120+ household variables, many
of which were highly correlated, model selection techniques were used to
successfully reduce dimensionality. A set of load profiles were compiled
based on the results (where normalized load was plotted as a function of
hour of day). It was determined that household behaviour and demographic
can be used to generate positive and negative energy efficiency
coefficients with respect to load profiles. This work has implications
for energy grid planning -- for example in high-density housing versus
suburban housing.

Karjalainen considers the manner in which smart meter data is
communicated to end users, with the principal purpose of the paper being
to study what kind of electricity consumption feedback consumers
understand and prefer (Karjalainen, 2011). It is noted that the most
effective feedback tools for engaging households in reducing energy
consumption are both computerized and interactive. In this work a series
of options for feedback is gathered, for example consumption (kHh),
power (W), cost (\$), environmental impact (e.g., kg CO2), total for
household, disaggregation by appliance, real time, hour, day, and so on.
Examples of feedback options are shown in Figure \textbf{X}, below.

The results of qualitative participant interviews clearly showed that
while some consumers are very interested in saving household
electricity, other consumers show only a little interest (\textbf{NOTE
they were asked about saving electricity, not about saving money or
convenience}). When specifically asked to list what measures (if any)
were typically taken at home to realize reductions in energy usage, some
respondents listed numerous measures, while others just said they turn
lights off in rooms that are empty. The author also found some
participants were unaware of differences in stand-by versus active modes
of operation for electrical appliances, resulting in practising
inefficient energy saving measures in the home environment. When
trialling feedback prototypes to participants, two main issues were
encountered: (1) many people are not familiar with scientific units and
do not understand the difference between W and kWh and (2) many people
do not understand how carbon dioxide emissions are related to
electricity consumption. It is perhaps surprising that the overall most
popular prototype was `6', below. Perhaps because unlike the other
prototypes, this clearly (the most clearly) articulates cost. The
concept of convenience was absent entirely from consideration.

In the domain of supply and demand economics, consumer behaviour and
smart appliances Kobus et al investigated if households can shift their
electricity demand to times when electricity is abundantly available
(Charlotte B.A. Kobus, 2015). Using a household electrical monitoring
system (EMS) coupled to a smart appliance (smart washing machine),
photovoltaic cells and the electricity grid, they were able to show that
households can shift 10--77\% of the electricity demand of their washing
machine. This longitudinal study was conducted via the participation of
50 Dutch households over a period of one year. By utilizing an EMS which
shows appliance status, dynamic tariff information and current status of
household electricity usage, participants are able to schedule smart
washing machine use in such a way that cost is minimized.

Their work is in response to two major challenges to domestic
electricity supply and demand. \textbf{REMOVED: It is well observed that
over electricity grids, demand shows a pattern over time, influenced by
natural and social circumstances. This poses a great challenge when
considering renewable energy sources like PV -- people are generally not
at home when local electricity is abundantly produced (for example the
daylight hours of Monday till Friday)} The first being that the amount
of distributed renewable electricity generation is increasing with time
(for example, as more households install photovoltaic (PV) panels), and
the second that electricity demand will continue to significantly
increase moving into the foreseeable future. These developments pose
great challenges to `traditional' power systems, where supply follows
demand entirely. Smart grids are proposed as a potential solution to
facilitate the affordable introduction of cleaner electricity producing
and consuming technologies.

Cetin et al consider electricity usage of appliance, as when aggregated,
this accounts for approximately 30 per cent of electricity used in the
residential building sector (K.S. Cetin, 2014). This, together with
small appliances, home electronics and lighting, account for more than
2/3 of total residential electricity use. Cetin et al also highlight
that influencing `time of use' is becoming increasingly important to
control the stress on today's electrical grid infrastructure. The
authors seek to determine when refrigerators, clothes washers, clothes
dryers and dishwashers are predominantly used (and thus consume energy)
and what causes variation in their use. Using disaggregated energy data
from 40 homes over a period of 1-year, normalized load profiles for the
four target appliances were generated, as a percentage of daily
electricity load.

It was found that the refrigerator had the most consistent consumption
profile across all homes surveyed. Influencing factors for the
refrigerator were correlated to both indoor and outdoor temperature,
however effect was found to be minimal. The clothes washer and dryer
were found to have the greatest variation in normalised energy use by
hour, with the greatest period of use from 9am until 2pm. The dishwasher
had distinct peaks in load profile at 9am and 10pm. The authors found
that user-dependent appliance use patterns vary more between homes and
between days than automated appliances, weekday and weekend use patterns
of appliances are similar, and that electricity use varies more between
houses during peak use times of day than during low-use times. Murray et
al further explore the topic of home appliance energy consumption using
smart meter data, specifically pertaining to residential activities
around food storage and preparation (D.M. Murray, 2018), with the aim of
providing a model that can easily be applied to existing smart meter
energy datasets. The authors use real-time energy consumption data from
microwaves and ovens, from which user behaviour / desired outcome can be
implicitly associated (for example, oven usage on a weekday between the
hours of 6pm and 8pm can be associated with the behaviour of preparing
dinner). Consideration is given to the concept of the RisingEdge (when
an appliance is switched on or moves to a high consuming state) and
FallingEdge (when an appliance is switched off or moves to a low
consuming state) of power consumption. Accurate energy consumption
models for major cooking appliances are successfully constructed,
further re-enforcing the value and widespread applicability of
residential smart meter data.

In this work,

This supports \_\_ that smart meters represent a valuable source of data
that can be used for a variety of purposes, beyond just real-time
monitoring. For example the model constructed by Murray et al does not
rely on difficult to obtain parameters such as food type, temperature
and weight. it has been shown that \ldots{}

\emph{Demand Response allows for the management of demand side resources
in real-time; i.e.~shifting electricity demand according to fluctuating
supply. When integrated into electricity markets, Demand Response can be
used for load shifting and as a replacement for both control reserve and
balancing energy. These three usage scenarios are compared based on
historic German data from 2011 to determine that load shifting provides
the highest benefit: its annual financial savings accumulate to €3.110M
for both households and the service sector. This equals to relative
savings of 2.83\% compared to a scenario without load shifting.}

{[}@article\{feuerriegel2016\}{]} discuss electricity demand response -
allowing the management of demand side resources in real-time.
\textbf{Based on Darby and McKenna (REF), we define demand response and
a household action (automated, manual, or both) due to which electricity
use is shifted in time in response to a price signal of other stimuli.
This can result in more efficient usage of the available sustainable
electricity, like self-consumption of on-site PV electricity (REF) and
peak demand reductions (REF) - all from @article\{kobus2015\}}

\subsubsection{Predictive Modelling and
Forecasting}\label{predictive-modelling-and-forecasting}}

In the domestic predictive energy consumption space Basu et al consider
home automation systems linked via a communication network to enable
interaction, data collation and control of appliances remotely by end
users (Kaustav Basu, 2012). The potential competing priorities of energy
savings versus comfort optimization for home occupants is discussed. The
objective of this work is to propose a learning system that is able to
help the home automation system compute an energetic plan that is also
satisfactory to user requests. Taking into account correlation between
appliances, a time-series based multi-label classifier is used to
predict appliance usage up to one hour into the future.

The attribute construction technique of Knowledge Extraction applied.
This process aims to extract novel attributes from underlying
substructures in the training instances in the form of sub-events, for
example periodicity in data. This Knowledge Extraction process is
similar to the implicit associations used by Murray et al, in the
analysis of energy consumption for food preparation (D.M. Murray, 2018).
The substructures are then fed to a propositional learner. The proposed
model is trained in an iterative manner and attempts to take into
account all the possible information based on consumption data, time of
the event and meteorological information. Time is specifically model
time as a periodic variable, segmenting on hour of day and day of week,
noting that this takes into account the periodic nature of human
behaviour. Using BR1, LP, CC1, CC2 and MLk machine learning algorithms,
the precision, recall and accuracy for a variety of
electricity-consuming appliances is determined (where each appliance
constitutes a target variable over a set of iterations). In the
evaluation phase they find that user behaviour toward an appliance is
highly variable and the predictability of an appliance is dependent on
the regularity of usage patterns of the inhabitants. It is specifically
noted that \emph{it is therefore very difficult for now to propose a
generic methodology of appliance prediction for private houses}.

Chou et al consider global energy consumption in the residential housing
sector in the context of domestic energy information system (EIS) and
smart meter system (smart grids) technologies (Jui-Sheng Chou, 2019).
They note two influential factors on overall residential energy
consumption, the first being the type and number of electrical
appliances and the second being the usage of these appliances by
occupants. It is proposed that a major challenge for people who are
willing to save energy at home is a lack of information about their
energy consumption. To test this hypothesis, the authors develop a
web-based energy information management system for the power consumption
of home appliances that monitors the energy load of a home, analyses its
energy consumption based on machine learning, and then sends information
to various stakeholders. Interaction with end-users in the home is
achieved via energy dashboards and emails. The authors propose that
end-users of this system can use forecast information and anomalous data
to enhance the efficiency of energy usage in their buildings especially
during peak times by adjusting the operating schedule of their
appliances and electrical equipment. \textbf{In order to achieve the
desired model (???)}

During this study, an EIS with 5 main components was installed in an
experimental building. The parts were as follows; (1) the internal
communication network, (2) the data management infrastructure, (3) the
automated prediction system, (4) the web-based system and dashboard and
(5) the early warning system. Data from both the smart meter and from
sensors was used to compile the model, including timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss), outdoor temperature (ºC), total building energy consumption
(kWh), aggregated energy consumption data (e.g., second floor lighting)
and individual appliances. The backend of the application was notably
cloud-hosted.

Convenience}\label{iot-and-end-user-convenience}}

The term Internet-of-Things (IoT) is used as an umbrella keyword for
covering various aspects related to the extension of the Internet and
the Web into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment
of spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing
and/or actuation capabilities (Daniele Miorandi, 2012). The IoT paradigm
is fundamental to this work, representing the confluence of multiple
technological advancements (Luigi Atzori, 2010) including, ubiquity of
internet access, the availability of high-performance internet
connectivity, inexpensive consumer electronics with embedded sensing and
control systems, automation, real-time analytics, machine learning,
commodity sensors and embedded systems. In the IoT paradigm, digital and
physical entities can be linked, by means of appropriate information and
communication technologies, to enable a whole new class of applications
and services (Daniele Miorandi, 2012).

One consequence resulting from the widespread deployment of consumer
electronics with IoT capability is the evolution of the Internet from
interconnecting computers to interconnecting things. Figure X, below,
shows XYZ.

Huang et al propose a novel service mining framework to personalize
services in an IoT-based smart home (Bing Huang, 2018). This work
considers the notion of personal `convenience' as a driving force behind
the provisioning of services to end users. That is, in an IoT smart
home, where everything is interconnect, can services (for example, the
switching on or off of a light) be automatically served to users such
that their level of effort (to interact with their surroundings) will be
diminished, and thus their level of convenience will be increased?

\subsubsection{Summary}\label{summary}}

In summary there is lots of variability and this informs the
construction of our model -- it must be robust. By stripping the time
variable this greatly simplifies modelling. As mentioned in the work of
Murray et al (Appliance electrical consumption modelling at scale using
smart meter data) smart home data contains implicit associations, the
example given being that, if a person is using the oven between the
hours of 6pm and 8pm on a weekday, it can be assumed they are preparing
dinner -- there is no need to explicitly determine this. In a similar
way, we \textbf{believe} that we can implicitly obtain spatial and
temporal information about how a series of appliances (electrical and
non-electrical) are interrelated.

As demonstrated above, there has been a vast swathe of work done in the
areas of smart meter data and predictive analytics, X, Y \& Z. What is,
however, of significant note, is the absence of holistic consideration
with respect to energy consumption, smart home data, predictive
analytics, IoT and end user convenience. As demonstrated above, numerous
studies have found that creating and maintaining behaviour (such as
monitoring a smart meter and then intervening) is \ldots{} shit.

Due to n = 1, it would be a fair criticism to say that the methodology
employed cannot claim to be robust\ldots{} this is fair. However, the
Kavousian et al thoroughly analyse the effect of household variables on
overall energy efficiency. Our analysis (n=1) has no such \ldots{} Take
for example Consumer preferences for feedback on household electricity
consumption (REF). The work considers, in isolation, the concept of
saving electricity. For example during participant interviews, the line
of questioning is framed around electricity saving NOT cost or
convenience.

The datasets were created during the thesis \emph{Activity Recognition
with End-User Sensor Installation in the Home} by Randy Joseph
Rockinson, Submitted to the Program of Media Arts and Sciences, School
of Architecture and Planning, in partial fulfilment of the requirement
for the degree of Master of Science in Media Arts and Sciences at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) February 2008 (REF).

The aim of Rockinson was to considered the effect of end user versus
professional installation of a sensor array in the home - on the basis
that, if installation of sensors is to be considered as a high initial
cost, and a barrier to entry for end users wanting this technology, is
there a difference if a professional versus an end user performs the
installation?

Between 80-100 reed switch sensors where installed in two single-person
apartments collecting data about human activity for two weeks. The
sensors were installed in everyday objects such as drawers,
refrigerators, containers, etc to record opening-closing events
(activation deactivation events) as the subject carried out everyday
activities.

Referering to the work of (\textbf{REF}) it is was determined that these

by the presense of one sensor per burner in the original work.While this
level of granularity may provide an avenue for further analysis, for the
purposes of this research such values serve to significantly increase
the dimensionality of the overall dataset, with a low corresponding gain
in information. High dimensionality can also lead to difficulties in
machine learning models and challenges with data visualisation. By way
of example, kitchen\_cabinet has a value of n=15, indicating that for
the various cabinets in the kitchen, a total of 15 sensors were fitted
to monitor activity. It was determined that such values would aggregated
and collapsed to a value of n=1 (with the first occurence of the
degenerate subactivity thus providing the subActNum). The data set was
inspected and stripped of special characters, and the sub activities
requiring an input of energy (e.g., electrical, gas) were flagged with a

The activities data was imported into an indexed dataframe, containing
only one column, with 1475 rows, with all values comma-separated (per
row). This style of import had to be used, due to the varying number of
comma-separated elements in each row (as seen in Figure
\ref{fig:s1actExcel}, above).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Between each increment of 5 (0 - 4), the sub-arrays have different
  lengths Table {[}ref{]}, below, contains a summary of the data
  structure after the operation \texttt{np.array(dsS1)} is performed. In
  order to continue pre-processing, the array had to be flattened from a
  2D structure to a 1D structure, using \texttt{flatten()}.
\end{itemize}

The function \texttt{dsS1Activities\_processing.py} was run in-line to
perform the required preprocessing. The dataframe was then converted to
a 2D array, using \texttt{np.array()}, here, each row from the dataframe
became an array within the 2D array {[}Step 1{]}. The 2D array was
flattened to a 1D array using \texttt{.flatten()} {[}Step 2{]}. each
group of observations was then chunked into a list of 5 {[}Step 3{]}

Mention sanity checking here

We used the Step 3 data structure to then extract the values for
\texttt{activity}, \texttt{date}, \texttt{startTime} and
\texttt{endTime}. These values were populated into a series of temporary
arrays, which were then compiled into a dataset with the four attributes
previously listed. We then used \texttt{Step3{[}i{]}{[}j{]}} to access
all the required elements and parse them into the arrays.

The following duplicate sensors were identified in section XX

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From \texttt{S1Sensors\_preprocessed.csv} I need to find the numbers
  associated with these - SUBACTNUM
\item
  `Arbitrarily' choose one number to represent all of them
\item
  Fill them all with that one number
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For dicussion later} - The kitchen cabinets have 15 sensors, say
one of these cabinets just contains a blender, so there will always be a
one-to-one between the cabinet opening and the blendor being used. This
isn't particularly helpful to us. Also, more sensors could always be
added\ldots{} Better to do analysis with less (explain?) Note for
discussion, S1Sensors\_preprocessed itself should no longer be modified,
EXAMPLE, going back upstream to remove the `dupes', would perhaps cause
an lack of traceability downstream later, Importing
S1Sensors\_preprecessed now has been done to inform, how to remove
`dupes' from the current ds
