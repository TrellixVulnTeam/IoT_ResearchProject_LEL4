  abstract = {The growing demand for energy and the increasing carbon footprint in the globe has made electricity utilities to move from non-renewable energy to renewable energy. The integration of renewables into the electric grid is increasing day-by-day. The consumers’ energy consumption needs to be managed wisely and effectively. The Internet of Things has helped in connecting all homes and appliances to the Internet. With smart homes, it is possible to study consumer’s usage patterns and their demand for energy. During peak hours of the day, the demand for energy increases and have to be met by the utilities by starting up additional coal-fired generation. This makes peak hour usage of electricity costly. This paper studies the usage behavior of consumers from their historical data and predicts the demand for energy every hour for the individual consumer for the next 72 hours using time series analysis. Also, the work statistically studies the usage pattern of appliances in every home thereby finding which appliances play a significant role during the peak hour usage. This work will help utilities understand how their consumers use electricity and can encourage consumers to shift usage of peak hour appliances to non-peak hours. Also, consumers can grant control of individual appliances to utilities, to curtail the load during peak hours to reduce the demand.},

Interest in the intelligent management of home energy consumption using data mining and time series analysis is increasing. Therefore, this work develops an efficient web-based energy information management system for the power consumption of home appliances that monitors the energy load of a home, analyzes its energy consumption based on machine learning, and then sends information to various stakeholders. It interacts with the end-user through energy dashboards and emails. The web-based system includes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence model to improve its prediction of energy usage. An automatic warning function is also developed to identify anomalous energy consumption in a home in real time. The cloud system automatically sends a message to the user's email whenever a warning is necessary. End-users of this system can use forecast information and anomalous data to enhance the efficiency of energy usage in their buildings especially during peak times by adjusting the operating schedule of their appliances and electrical equipment.},

  abstract = {Governments across the world are investing in smart metering devices that report energy use to the user with the aim of reducing consumption. However, the effectiveness of such In-Home Displays (IHDs) has been questioned, since savings are small. This is possibly because informing the consumer of their consumption in kWh, or monetary units, fails to give context, or inform of possible actions to reduce consumption. We investigate, for the first time, the effect of replacing the simple statement of energy use an IHD gives, with a detailed array of information specifically designed to improve consumer energy literacy and suggest behaviour change through personalised actionable messages set against a series of psychological value systems for context, and which can identify potential profligacy. The results from a carefully controlled field experiment show: 1) value framing and action prompts have a significant effect on occupants' behaviour, with the mean temperature of homes being reduced from 22.4 °C to 21.7 °C, and a marked reduction in gas consumption—22.0\% overall and 27.2\% in high consumers; 2) energy literacy increasing from 0.52 to 1.28 (on a 0–4 scale); 3) it is possible to target potentially profligate households, without inappropriately messaging others; 4) engagement is high, with 82\% of the participants finding the system useful. These results emphasize the necessity of improving energy literacy when encouraging energy efficient behaviours and point to a new generation of smart meters with the potential to increase energy literacy, make much greater savings and impact climate change policy.},

  abstract = {Following liberalization reforms, the ability of power markets to provide satisfactory incentives for capacity investments has become a major concern. In particular, current energy markets can exhibit a phenomenon of investment cycles, which generate phases of under and over-capacity, and hence additional costs and risks for generation adequacy. To cope with these issues, new mechanisms, called capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRM), have been (or will be) implemented. This paper assesses the dynamic effects of two CRMs, the capacity market and the strategic reserve mechanism, and studies to what extent they can reduce the investment cycles. Generation costs and shortage costs of both mechanisms are also compared to conclude on their effectivity and economic efficiency. A simulation model, based on system dynamics, is developed to study the functioning of both CRMs and the related investment decisions. The results highlight the benefits of deploying CRMs to solve the adequacy issue: shortages are strongly reduced compared to an energy-only market. Besides, the capacity market appears to be more beneficial, since it experiences fewer shortages and generation costs are lower. These comparisons can be used by policy makers (in particular in Europe, where these two CRMs are mainly debated) to determine which CRM to adopt.},

Most liberalized electricity markets have a poor track record at encouraging the deployment of smart meters and the development of demand response. In Europe, different models are considered for demand response, from a development under a regulated regime to a development under competitive perspectives. In this paper focusing on demand response and smart metering for mid-size and small consumers, we investigate which types of market signals should be sent to demand managers to see demand response emerge as a competitive activity. Using data from the French power system over nine years, we compare the possible market design options which would enable the development of demand response. Our simulations demonstrate that under the current market rules demand response is not a profitable activity in the French electricity industry. Introducing a capacity market could bring additional revenues to demand response providers and improve incentives to put in place demand response programs in a market environment.},

To start to address this knowledge gap, the present research used qualitative data analysis to examine how consumers use and respond to energy monitors. The findings suggest feedback may increase both the physical and conscious visibility of consumption as well as knowledge about consumption. Accordingly, support was evident for the theoretical assertions that feedback transforms energy from invisible to visible, prompts motivated users to learn about their energy habits, and helps address information deficits about energy usage. We conclude by evaluating the feasibility of feedback to substantially reduce consumption and discuss ways in which feedback could be improved to aid its effectiveness in the long term before discussing the implication our findings may have for government policy.},

However, none of these studies tell us why real-time information changes energy-use behavior. We explore the causal mechanisms through which real-time information affects energy consumption by conducting a randomized-control trial with residential households. The experiment attempts to disentangle two competing mechanisms: (i) learning about the energy consumption of various activities, the “learning effect”, versus (ii) having a constant reminder of energy use, the “saliency effect”. We have two main results. First, we find a statistically significant treatment effect from receiving real-time information. Second, we find that learning plays a more prominent role than saliency in driving energy conservation. Our findings support the use of energy conservation programs that target consumer knowledge regarding the energy use of different devices and activities.},

  abstract = {To efficiently facilitate the energy transition it is essential to evaluate the potential of demand response in practice. Based on the results of a Dutch smart grid pilot, this paper assesses the potential of both manual and semi-automated demand response in residential areas. To stimulate demand response, a dynamic tariff and smart appliances were used. The participating households were informed about the tariff day-ahead through a home energy management system, connected to a display installed on the wall in their living room. The tariff was intuitively displayed: self-consumption of photovoltaic generation was stimulated by means of a low tariff, but also the generation itself played a central role on the display. Household flexibility is analyzed, focusing on: (i) the load shift of (smart) appliances, and (ii) the response of the (overall) peak load towards the dynamic tariff. To assess the latter, i.e. price responsiveness, the participants were split up in two comparable groups which were subject to a different moment of evening peak-pricing. Based on the results, it is concluded that mainly the flexibility of the white goods (i.e. the washing machine, tumble dryer and dishwasher) is used for demand response. The main part of the flexible load of these (smart) appliances is shifted from the evening to the midday, to match local generation. This load shift remained stable over a long period of time ({$>$}1year) and is not responsive to the exact moment of peak-pricing. Therefore, it is concluded that a simple and transparent design for dynamic tariffs is sufficient and most effective to stimulate (manual) residential demand response. Such a tariff should emphasize the ‘right’ moments to use electricity, intuitively linked to renewable generation.},

The flexibility potential of the smart appliances, or the maximal amount of time a certain increase or decrease of power can be realized within the comfort requirements of the user, is calculated. In general, the flexibility potential varies during the day, and the potential for increasing or decreasing the power consumption is in general not equal. Additionally, an extrapolation of the flexibility potential of wet appliances is presented for Belgium. The analysis shows that, using smart wet appliances, an average maximum increase of 430W per household can be realized at midnight, and a maximum decrease of 65W per household can be realized in the evening. The resulting flexibility potential can be used as an instrument to determine the impact or economic viability of demand response programs for residential premises.},

We conclude by noting that, in their current form, existing in-home-displays may not induce the desired energy-reduction response anticipated by smart metering initiatives.

  abstract = {Unprecedented changes have occurred over the last five years in the way customers use electricity. These changes are driving electricity distributors to evolve and extend their demand management capabilities to include grid balancing, respond to localised demand and promote and activate smart appliances. In South East Queensland, Australia, two successful forward looking demand management programs are well established. More than 50,000 demand response ready air conditioners have been connected to the network and are able to be controlled by the distributor. Results show that demand reductions from these air conditioners are reliable and sustained for the period of demand events. A second program uses controlled load electric hot water systems as a ‘solar sponge’ to integrate renewables into the network. This article highlights the potential demand management benefits of using hot water systems to reduce the localised peaks and fill the midday demand trough. The results from both programs show the capability of these demand management tools to improve network utilisation and grid balancing and reduce overall network expenditure. A further demand management initiative identified as having the greatest likelihood of success in delivering benefits to both the utility and customer are tariff structures which incorporate cost reflective pricing. In this way, time of use and magnitude of demand are addressed and positive price signals encouraging load control of appliances are provided. This coupling of demand management and tariffs is shown to be highly effective in achieving demand reductions. Automated load control can support customers’ acceptance of new pricing approaches and provide a ‘set and forget’ solution for optimising the benefits of cost reflective tariffs. The challenge for distributors is how to transition the existing demand management incentives and tariffs to a sustainable future program in an increasingly disaggregated and competitive market.},

Moreover, the model accounts for phenomena related to unexpected weather conditions and local/national events, e.g. TV shows. The main aim of model is to generate high-resolution household load profiles for investigation of flexibility potential of domestic appliances and network modelling.The model is validated with two datasets of 1-h and 5-min data from 89 to 16 households, respectively. The comparison between measured and modelled values indicates that model well captures the characteristics of domestic electricity load profiles on a daily as well seasonal basis. For high-resolution data, the model represents well the differences in demand between households of dissimilar size as well as the diversity of demand between households of the same size. For the individual household, the high-end power consumption is under-represented since the timing of peaks is more diverse in the model.},

Energy management systems and smart appliances can facilitate this by supporting the user to shift electricity demand of appliances to moments in time when electricity is abundantly available. However, the benefits resulting from domestic demand response depend on household acceptance and behaviour change. This paper explores the real electricity demand shift of households in time and the role of smart appliances to bring about this shift. A longitudinal study was conducted among Dutch households over a period of one year. The households received a dynamic electricity tariff, an energy management system and a smart washing machine. Results show that households shift their usage of the smart washing machine mostly to the day when the sun is shining and electricity is produced by their own solar panels. Households who regularly used automation of the smart washing machine, which implicates that the use of the washing machine is automatically shifted to time periods where electricity supply is abundantly available, were more likely to shift their electricity usage. Furthermore, during the course of one year, the results remained stable, indicating a structural shift in demand.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for estimating the demand response potential of residential air conditioning (A/C), using hourly electricity consumption data (“smart meter” data) from 30,000 customer accounts in Northern California. We apply linear regression and unsupervised classification methods to hourly, whole-home consumption and outdoor air temperature data to determine the hours, if any, that each home׳s A/C is active, and the temperature dependence of consumption when it is active. When results from our sample are scaled up to the total population, we find a maximum of 270–360MW (95\% c.i.) of demand response potential over a 1-h duration with a 4°F setpoint change, and up to 3.2–3.8GW of short-term curtailment potential. The estimated resource correlates well with the evening decline of solar production on hot, summer afternoons, suggesting that demand response could potentially act as reserves for the grid during these periods in the near future with expected higher adoption rates of solar energy. Additionally, the top 5\% of homes in the sample represent 40\% of the total MW-hours of DR resource, suggesting that policies and programs to take advantage of this resource should target these high users to maximize cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {As access to residential energy use data becomes more widely available, it is possible to identify significant energy consumers and provide guidance on mitigating such large loads. In hotter climates, such as Texas, air-conditioning (AC) systems are important contributors to overall residential electricity demand. Providing a quick, simple and effective framework to describe and compare electricity demand patterns between different houses is valuable to identify potential candidates for peak load reduction and overall energy use mitigation. In this study, we evaluate the application of daily change-point models to describe the demand patterns of residential AC systems for 45 actual houses in Austin, TX during 2013. While previous research regarding change-point models has been focused on monthly data for commercial buildings, this study extends its application to daily residential energy use. The resulting models describe a behavior where energy consumption with relation to outdoor dry-bulb temperature is negligible up until a change-point, after which AC energy use increases linearly and results in an “energy slope.” An analysis of the neighborhood shows the distribution of the AC “energy slopes” is left-skewed and centered on 0.08kW per °C dry bulb temperature. Energy audit information found eight house characteristics to be correlated with a higher energy slope. A subsequent parametric analysis using data from the energy simulation software BEopt confirmed the direction of the correlation. This work provides a screening tool to compare energy demand patterns of houses and target houses with the largest magnitude of energy slopes for future energy audits.},

The best model (GBM) was able to explain 97\% of the variance (R2) in the training set and with 57\% in the testing set when using all the predictors.

Specific appliances included: room air-conditioners, room heaters, refrigerators, freezers and domestic hot-water systems, all of which exhibited some degree of weather sensitivity, particularly space heating and cooling devices. Probit regression techniques were used to predict the degree–day values at which households tend to switch on heating and cooling appliances. All appliances demonstrated weather sensitivity to varying degrees, and this was universally stronger during the cooling season (summer) than during the heating season (winter). The outdoor SET∗ version of the degree–day index demonstrated a stronger statistical association with space-cooling energy consumption than conventional air temperature degree–days. The mean daily temperature associated with minimum heating and cooling energy consumption for Sydney indicated that a temperature of 18°C was the most appropriate base temperature for calculation of both heating and cooling degree–days.},

As influencing the time-of-use of energy becomes increasingly important to control the stress on today's electrical grid infrastructure, understanding when appliances use energy and what causes variation in their use are of great importance. However, there is limited appliance-specific data available to understand their use patterns. This study provides daily energy use profiles of four major household appliances: refrigerator, clothes washer, clothes dryer, and dishwasher, through analyzing disaggregated energy use data collected for 40 single family homes in Austin, TX. The results show that when compared to those assumed in current energy simulation software for residential buildings, the averaged appliance load profiles have similar daily distributions. Refrigerators showed the most constant and consistent use. However, the three user-dependent appliances, appliances which depend on users to initiate use, varied more greatly between houses and by time-of-day. During peak use times, on weekends, and in homes with household members working at home, the daily use profiles of appliances were less consistent.},

This paper is focused on the residential consumption phase of the food life cycle assessment (LCA), i.e., energy consumption during home cooking. Specifically, while much effort has been placed on improving appliance energy efficiency, appliance models used in various applications, including the food LCA, are not updated regularly. This process is hindered by the fact that the cooking appliance models are either very cumbersome, requiring knowledge of parameters which are difficult to obtain or dependent on manufacturers' data which do not always reflect variable cooking behaviour of the general public. This paper proposes a methodology for generating accurate appliance models from energy consumption data, obtained by smart meters that are becoming widely available worldwide, without detailed knowledge of additional parameters such as food being prepared, mass of food, etc. Furthermore, the proposed models, due to the nature of smart meter data, are built incorporating actual usage patterns reflecting specific cooking practice. We validate our results from large, geographically spread energy datasets and demonstrate, as a case study, the impact of up-to-date models in the consumption phase of food LCA.},

In an attempt to counter this increase, various initiatives have been introduced to promote the replacement of less energy-efficient appliances with more efficient ones. Whilst the likely aggregate effect of such measures over long time periods has been modelled extensively, little is known about the affect that a change to higher efficiency appliances will have on the electrical demand profile of individual households at higher temporal resolutions. To address this issue a means by which established approaches to detailed electrical demand modelling can be adapted to simulate the improvements in the efficiency of appliances is elaborated in this paper. A process is developed by which low-resolution empirical appliance demand data can be transformed to produce high-resolution electrical demand data for different periods in the year, factoring in improvements in appliance performance. The process is applied to simulate the effects a changeover to more energy-efficient appliances would have on the minute resolution demand profiles of a group of households. Results indicate that improving the energy-efficiency of appliances in households leads to a significant reduction in electrical energy requirements but does not appear to have a significant affect on the peak electrical demand.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a novel method to rank residential appliance energy efficiency utilizing energy efficiency frontiers. The method is validated using a real-world case study of 4231 buildings in Ireland. Our results show that structural factors have the largest impact on energy efficiency, followed by socioeconomic factors and behavioral factors. For example, households with high penetration of efficient lightbulbs and double-glazed windows were on average 4 and 3.5\% more efficient than others. Households with the head of household having higher education are on average 1.3\% more efficient than their peers. Finally, households that track their energy savings are on average 0.4\% more efficient than others. Furthermore, installing heater timers, wall insulation, and living in owned residences were correlated with higher efficiency. Generally, families with kids who have full-time employment and are highly-educated are more efficient compared to families with no kids, or families with retirees or unemployed members. This result has important implications for both targeting and messaging of energy efficiency programs. Some behavioral factors demonstrated significant impact on appliance energy efficiency. For instance, households that expressed interest in making major energy-saving lifestyle changes scored higher efficiency ranks on average. Conversely, households that expressed doubt about their motivation to save energy ranked lower in efficiency. This finding validates the role of educational programs to increase awareness about energy efficiency and its importance. In short, our results show that a data-driven analysis of a population is needed to develop a balanced view of the drivers of energy efficiency, and to devise a targeted approach to improve homes’ energy efficiency.},

Here we explore householders’ perceptions of energy consumption, using a novel combination of card-sorting and clustering to reveal shared patterns in the way people think about domestic energy consumption. The data suggest that, when participants were asked to group appliances which they felt naturally ‘went together’, there are relatively few shared ideas about which appliances are conceptually related. To the extent participants agreed on which appliances belonged together, these groupings were based on activities (e.g., entertainment) and location within the home (e.g., kitchen); energy consumption was not an important factor in people’s categorisations. This suggests messages about behaviour change aimed at reducing energy consumption might better be tied to social practices than to consumption itself.},

  abstract = {Traditional frequent sequential pattern mining only considers the time point-based item or event in the patterns. However, in many application, the events may span over multiple time points and the relations among events are also important. Time interval-based pattern mining is proposed to mine the interesting patterns of events that span over some time periods and also by considering the relations among events. Previous works of time interval-based pattern mining focused on the relations between events without considering the duration of each event. However, the same event with different time duration may cause different results. In this work, we propose two algorithms, SARA and SARS, for mining frequent time interval-based events with duration, TIED, patterns. TIED patterns not only keep the relations between two events but also reveal the time periods when each event happens and ends. For the performance evaluation, we propose a naive algorithm and modify a previous algorithm along with the implementation of SARA and SARS. The experimental results show that SARA and SARS are more efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage than other two algorithms. Moreover, we extend this work by considering utility value or importance of event in each time stamp. Therefore, we propose another new High Utility Time Interval-based Events with Duration, HU-TIED, pattern. HU-TIED incorporates the concept of utility pattern mining and TIED pattern mining. We design an algorithm, LMSpan, to mine top-K HU-TIED patterns. For the performance evaluation, we design a baseline algorithm, GenerateNCheck to compare with LMSpan. LMSpan takes less time and memory and generates less candidates than GenerateNCheck.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a robust location-aware activity recognition approach for establishing ambient intelligence applications in a smart home. with observations from a variety of multimodal and unobtrusive wireless sensors seamlessly integrated into ambient-intelligence compliant objects (AICOs), the approach infers a single resident's interleaved activities by utilizing a generalized and enhanced Bayesian Network fusion engine with inputs from a set of the most informative features. These features are collected by ranking their usefulness in estimating activities of interest. Additionally, each feature reckons its corresponding reliability to control its contribution in cases of possible device failure, therefore making the system more tolerant to inevitable device failure or interference commonly encountered in a wireless sensor network, and thus improving overall robustness. This work is part of an interdisciplinary Attentive Home pilot project with the goal of fulfilling real human needs by utilizing context-aware attentive services. We have also created a novel application called “Activity Map” to graphically display ambient-intelligence-related contextual information gathered from both humans and the environment in a more convenient and user-accessible way. All experiments were conducted in an instrumented living lab and their results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. Note to Practitioners—This system aims to achieve non-obtrusive and location-aware activity recognition, and the authors have successfully prototyped several AICOs to naturally collect interactions from residents or status from the environment. In addition, these AICOs have the potential to be commercialized in the future due to practicability and near-term advances in embedded systems. Furthermore, other potential advantages of an AICO lie in its applicability to other domains beyond just the home environment. Our initial work has yielded high overall accuracy, therefore, suggesting that it is a feasible approach that may lead to practical ambient intelligent applications (such as the Activity Map in this work). The limitations are that some currently available sensors cannot measure specific desired observations, or, in some cases, require users to carry them to operate.},

The nature of human activity characterized by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty, however, poses a great challenge to the design of good feature representations and the optimization of classifiers towards building a robust model for human activity recognition. In this study, we propose to exploit deep learning techniques to automatically learn high-level features from the binary sensor data under the assumption that there exist discriminative latent patterns inherent in the simple low-level features. Specifically, we extract high-level features with a stacked autoencoder that has a deep and hierarchy architecture, and combine feature learning and classifier construction into a unified framework to obtain a jointly optimized activity recognizer. Besides, we investigate two different original feature representations of the sensor data for latent feature learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available smart home datasets, and compare it with a range of shallow models in terms of time-slice accuracy and class accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better recognition rates and generalizes better across different original feature representations, indicating its applicability to the real-world activity recognition.},

This article investigates the mining of a new kind of contrast patterns, namely discriminating inter-attribute functions (DIFs), which represent arithmetic-expression-based inter-attribute relationships that distinguish classes of data. DIFs are an expressive and practical alternative of item-based contrast patterns and can express discriminating relationships such as “weight/(height)2 is more likely to be ≤25 in one class than in another class.” Besides introducing the DIF mining problem, this article makes theoretical and algorithmic contributions on the problem. We prove that DIF mining is MAX SNP-hard. Regarding how to efficiently mine DIFs, we present a set of rules to prune the search space of arithmetic expressions by eliminating redundant ones (equivalent to some others). We give two algorithms: one for finding all DIFs satisfying given thresholds and another for finding certain optimal DIFs using genetic computation techniques. The former is useful when the number of attributes is small, whereas the latter is useful when that number is large; both use the redundant arithmetic-expression pruning rules. A performance study shows that our techniques are effective and efficient for finding DIFs.},

To build an effective representation for prediction, human activities can be characterized by a complex temporal composition of constituent simple actions and interacting objects.

The major contributions of our work include: (1) a general framework is proposed to systematically address the problem of complex activity prediction by mining temporal sequence patterns; (2) probabilistic suffix tree (PST) is introduced to model causal relationships between constituent actions, where both large and small order Markov dependencies between action units are captured; (3) the context-cue, especially interactive objects information, is modeled through sequential pattern mining (SPM), where a series of action and object co-occurrence are encoded as a complex symbolic sequence; (4) we also present a predictive accumulative function (PAF) to depict the predictability of each kind of activity. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on two experimental scenarios with two data sets for each: action-only prediction and context-aware prediction.

CMG contains a new set of symbols elicited from domain experts to capture the recurring interaction mechanisms between multiple concepts in software dependability engineering. Furthermore, compared to major existing graphic methods, CMG is particularly robust and suitable for mental knowledge elicitation: it allows one to represent the full range of cause-effect knowledge, accurately or fuzzily as one sees fit depending on the depth of knowledge he/she has. This feature combined with excellent reliability and validity poses CMG as a promising method that has the potential to be used in various areas, such as software dependability requirement elicitation, software dependability assessment and dependability risk control.},

  abstract = {Web services are an emerging technology to implement and integrate business processes within and across enterprises. Service orientation can be used to decompose complex systems into loosely coupled software components that may run remotely. However, the distributed nature of services complicates the design and analysis of service-oriented systems that support end-to-end business processes. Fortunately, services leave trails in so-called event logs and recent breakthroughs in process mining research make it possible to discover, analyze, and improve business processes based on such logs. Recently, the task force on process mining released the process mining manifesto. This manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. The active participation from end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrate the growing significance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. In this paper, we focus on the opportunities and challenges for service mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to services. We discuss the guiding principles and challenges listed in the process mining manifesto and also highlight challenges specific for service-orientated systems.},

  abstract = {The interaction between biological researchers and the bioinformatics tools they use is still hampered by incomplete interoperability between such tools. To ensure interoperability initiatives are effectively deployed, end-user applications need to be aware of, and support, best practices and standards. Here, we report on an initiative in which software developers and genome biologists came together to explore and raise awareness of these issues: BioHackathon 2009. Developers in attendance came from diverse backgrounds, with experts in Web services, workflow tools, text mining and visualization. Genome biologists provided expertise and exemplar data from the domains of sequence and pathway analysis and glyco-informatics. One goal of the meeting was to evaluate the ability to address real world use cases in these domains using the tools that the developers represented. This resulted in i) a workflow to annotate 100,000 sequences from an invertebrate species; ii) an integrated system for analysis of the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) enriched based on differential gene expression data obtained from a microarray experiment; iii) a workflow to enumerate putative physical protein interactions among enzymes in a metabolic pathway using protein structure data; iv) a workflow to analyze glyco-gene-related diseases by searching for human homologs of glyco-genes in other species, such as fruit flies, and retrieving their phenotype-annotated SNPs. Beyond deriving prototype solutions for each use-case, a second major purpose of the BioHackathon was to highlight areas of insufficiency. We discuss the issues raised by our exploration of the problem/solution space, concluding that there are still problems with the way Web services are modeled and annotated, including: i) the absence of several useful data or analysis functions in the Web service "space"; ii) the lack of documentation of methods; iii) lack of compliance with the SOAP/WSDL specification among and between various programming-language libraries; and iv) incompatibility between various bioinformatics data formats. Although it was still difficult to solve real world problems posed to the developers by the biological researchers in attendance because of these problems, we note the promise of addressing these issues within a semantic framework.},

To date, enabling composite services has largely been an ad hoc, time-consuming, and error-prone process involving repetitive low-level programming. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based framework for the automatic composition of Web services. We present a technique to generate composite services from high-level declarative descriptions. We define formal safeguards for meaningful composition through the use of composability rules. These rules compare the syntactic and semantic features of Web services to determine whether two services are composable. We provide an implementation using an E-government application offering customized services to indigent citizens.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome sequencing projects and further systematic functional analyses of complete gene sets are producing an unprecedented mass of molecular information for a wide range of model organisms. This provides us with a detailed account of the cell with which we may begin to build models for simulating intracellular molecular processes to predict the dynamic behavior of living cells. Previous work in biochemical and genetic simulation has isolated well-characterized pathways for detailed analysis, but methods for building integrative models of the cell that incorporate gene regulation, metabolism and signaling have not been established. We, therefore, were motivated to develop a software environment for building such integrative models based on gene sets, and running simulations to conduct experiments in silico. RESULTS: E-CELL, a modeling and simulation environment for biochemical and genetic processes, has been developed. The E-CELL system allows a user to define functions of proteins, protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, regulation of gene expression and other features of cellular metabolism, as a set of reaction rules. E-CELL simulates cell behavior by numerically integrating the differential equations described implicitly in these reaction rules. The user can observe, through a computer display, dynamic changes in concentrations of proteins, protein complexes and other chemical compounds in the cell. Using this software, we constructed a model of a hypothetical cell with only 127 genes sufficient for transcription, translation, energy production and phospholipid synthesis. Most of the genes are taken from Mycoplasma genitalium, the organism having the smallest known chromosome, whose complete 580 kb genome sequence was determined at TIGR in 1995. We discuss future applications of the E-CELL system with special respect to genome engineering. AVAILABILITY: The E-CELL software is available upon request.

  abstract = {There is growing global consensus that the Information and communication technologies (ICTs), and particularly Internet are providing a new framework and huge opportunities for economic, political and social development. The World Summit for Social Development (WSSD, Copenhagen, 1995) recognized that the new information technologies and new approaches to access to and use of technologies by people living in poverty can help in fulfilling social development goals; and therefore recognize the need to facilitate access to such technologies. WSSD emphasized that promoting access for all to education, information, technology and know-how is an essential means for enhancing communication and participation in civil, political, economic, social and cultural life, and for ensuring respect for civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.}

  abstract = {Norms shift and emerge in response to technological innovation. One such innovation is Smart Meters – components of Smart Grid energy systems capable of minute-to-minute transmission of consumer electricity use information. We integrate theory from sociological research on social norms and privacy to examine how privacy threats affect the demand for and expectations of norms that emerge in response to new technologies, using Smart Meters as a test case. Results from three vignette experiments suggest that increased threats to privacy created by Smart Meters are likely to provoke strong demand for and expectations of norms opposing the technology and that the strength of these normative rules is at least partly conditional on the context. Privacy concerns vary little with actors’ demographic characteristics. These findings contribute to theoretical understanding of norm emergence and have practical implications for implementing privacy protections that effectively address concerns of electricity users.},
