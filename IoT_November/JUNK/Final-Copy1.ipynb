    "Since the inception of the first home computers in 1977 (REF)<cite data-cite=\"7169703/23A77C9T\"></cite>, modern society has become utterly dependent on and indeed, inexorably bound to digital technology. The rapid and widespread adoption of computational technology has led to the fastest rate of societal and economic development our species has ever experienced. One need only consider that between the years of X and Y, #### number of people gained access to the WWW [mention benefits of WWW for end users?], to appreciate the magnitude of this digital technology. Such rapid and widespread adoption has created a seemingly insatiable demand for __. </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "Indeed, our quest for exponentially greater computational power and digital storage capacity has led to a new and utterly ubiquitous technological paradigm; Cloud Computing (REF), defined as; The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cloud-computing). </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "As with the original WWW, Cloud Computing itself acts as a facilitator for new technologies. One such example being the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The Internet of Things can be surmised as the extension of the Internet and the Web into the physical realm, by means of the widespread deployment of spatially distributed devices with embedded identification, sensing and/or actuation capabilities [@article{miorandi2012}]. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables physical devices to connect and exchange information, and also allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely through the internet (@article{huang2018} @ 1 of @article{huang2018}) The IoT paradigm enables physical devices to connect and exchange information. IoT devices allow objects to be sensed or controlled remotely through the Internet [@article{atzori2010}]. IoT thus represents a convergence of real-world objects and digital objects into seamless (seamless?) and unified cyber-physical system. </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "Considering again the bigger picture of societal benefit, Figure X, shows that the benefits of technological deployment have been widely adopted and exploited. However, the success of modern human society is not without consequence. Paradoxically, all of the benefits our society has enjoyed from the development, production and deployment of technology, has required vast amounts of energy. This energy has, since the industrial revolution, primarily been derived from the burning of fossil fuels (REF). The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that ABC by XYZ if we do not do blah (REF). As exemplified by figure Y (co-inciding to the time period of figure X) global greenhouse gas emissions are steadily increasing (REF). At the current rate, blah et al estimate that in 20##, humans will be living in an atmospheric conditions not experienced since #### the mezozoic era, XX years before the evolution of modern humans (REF, REF). </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "It is therefore imperative moving forward as a species that all steps are be taken to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases and abate the advance of anthropomorphic climate change. The scale of the challenge is such that technology itself will prove critical in effectively combatting this extential threat to civilisation. When considering energy consumption, the industrial sector (including the non-combusted use of fuels) currently consumes around half of all global energy and feedstock fuels, with residential and commercial buildings (29%) and transport (21%) accounting for the remainder (https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/energy-outlook/demand-by-sector.html). </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "With residential and commercial buildings accounting for 29% of energy demand globally (REF). A qualitative assessment of figures X Y and Z show that our increased energy consumption has coincided with our staggerings global acheivements, including lifting millions out of poverty blah blah blah. We have more development we use more energy, but we have more development we are better off in all ways. We ALSO have more internet connectivity. </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> \n",
    "It therefore stands that the key to continues human prosperity is to de-couple energy demand growth from economic growth. Clearly economic prosperity is a direct contributing factor to human prosperity in general. One such avenue for reduced energy consumption is the optimization of existing services, utilities, and so on. </p>\n",

    "Upon compilation of the above summary list, and with reference to the original work  is was determined that these values result from multiple sensors with extremely similar functionality. For example, kitchen_burner has a value of n=4 - this is because on the burner in the apartment under investigation, there were 4 individual burners present. Similarly, kitchen_cabinet has a value of n=15, indicating that for the various cabinets in the apartment, each were given sensors. On the one-hand, this level of granularity may provide fertile grounds for advanced analysis, HOWEVER, for the purposes of this research project, such values will serve to increase the dimensionality of the overall dataset. High dimensionality can lead to difficulties with plotting, .... ML (REF) and thus IN A SUBSEQUENT PREPROCESSING exercise these values will be collapsed down to have n=1. <br>\n",

Whereas, if a sub-activity is able to be performed through only interaction with the end user, it will be classified as `energyReq` = false. By way of example, the sub-activity `bathroom_toiletflush` will have an `energyReq` equal to false, while the sub-activity `bathroom_lightswitch` will have an `energyReq` equal to true.

The service relationships are modeled based on spatial-temporal aspects, environment, people, and operation. An ontology-based service model is proposed to describe services. We present a set of metrics to evaluate the interestingness of discovered service relationships. Analytical and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation measures.",
