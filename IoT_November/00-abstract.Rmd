Previously collected sensor data of domestic activities, including activity, start time and end time was evaluated and subsequently cleansed of outliers. Values with an extremely low overall aggregated count were dropped from the dataset, as were values deemed to be highly irrelevant to our analysis. With respect to outlier cleansing, median was found to be a better overall value to fill rather than mean, owing to the extremely large spread of the data. The cleansed dataset was then converted to a boolean-array structure, where each attribute was a domestic activity and the index was a timestamp list. In this structure a '1' was representative of an on state, while a '0' was representative of an off state. This consideration applied equally to activities in the data set that were both energy consuming (e.g., using a lamp) and not energy consuming (e.g., opening a door). A machine learning wrapper method was created to iteratively train and test for each attribute. The method was based on a decision tree model with hyperparameter optimization via grid search over the split criterion ('gini' and 'entropy') maximum depth. Cross validation was performed over five-folds. Using all attributes from the dataset, the model gave varied performance, most likely due to the large imbalance of values in the dataset. The machine learning analysis was repeated using training for only activities requiring energy input. These results were largely similar to the first iteration. Finally, the wrapper method was extended to include consideration of power costs (in kilowatt hours) and appliance energy consumption (in watts) in addition to an antagonistic feature which aimed to reduced the overall period of time an appliance is in an 'on' state. The logic of this model was found to be sound, and improvements to the base machine learning model are recommended to improve the overall performance.
