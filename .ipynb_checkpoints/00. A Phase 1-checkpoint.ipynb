The rapid and widespread adoption of computational technology has led to the fastest rate of development (societal, economic, e.t.c.,) our species has ever experienced. Indeed, our quest for exponentially greater computational power and digital storage capacity has led to a new and utterly ubiquitous technological paradigm; Cloud Computing (REF), defined as; The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer (https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cloud-computing). <br>\n",

For example, kitchen_burner has a value of n=4 - this is because on the burner in the apartment under investigation, there were 4 individual burners present. Similarly, kitchen_cabinet has a value of n=15, indicating that for the various cabinets in the apartment, each were given sensors. On the one-hand, this level of granularity may provide fertile grounds for advanced analysis, HOWEVER, for the purposes of this research project, such values will serve to increase the dimensionality of the overall dataset. High dimensionality can lead to difficulties with plotting, .... ML (REF) and thus IN A SUBSEQUENT PREPROCESSING exercise these values will be collapsed down to have n=1."

     "abstract": "Inrecentyears,energy information systems have had an important role in the operational optimization of intelligent buildings to provide such benefits as high efficiency, energy savings and smart services. Interest in the intelligent management of home energy consumption using data mining and time series analysis is increasing. Therefore, this work develops an efficient web-based energy information management system for the power consumption of home appliances that monitors the energy load of a home, analyzes its energy consumption based on machine learning, and then sends information to various stakeholders. It interacts with the end-user through energy dashboards and emails. The web-based system includes a novel hybrid artificial intelligence model to improve its prediction of energy usage. An automatic warning function is also developed to identify anomalous energy consumption in a home in real time. The cloud system automatically sends a message to the user's email whenever a warning is necessary. End-users of this system can use forecast information and anomalous data to enhance the efficiency of energy usage in their buildings especially during peak times by adjusting the operating schedule of their appliances and electrical equipment.",

     "abstract": "During the past several years, researchers have demonstrated that when new wireless sensors are placed in the home environment, data collected from them can be used bysoftware to automatically infer context, such as the activities of daily living. This context-inference can then be exploited in novel applications for healthcare, communication, education, and entertainment. Prior work on automatic context-inference has cleared the way to a reduction in costs associated with manufacturing the sensor technologies and computing resources required by these systems. However, this prior work does not specifically address another major expense of wide-scale deployment of the proposed systems: the expense of expert installation of the sensor devices. To date, most of the context-detection algorithms proposed assume that an expert carefully installs the home sensors and that an expert is involved in acquiring the necessary training examples. End-user sensor installation may offer several advantages over professional sensor installations: 1.) It may greatly reduces the high cost of time required for an expert installation, especially if large numbers of sensors are required for an application, 2.) The process of installing the sensors may give the users a greater sense of control over the technology in their homes, and 3.) End-User Installations also may improve algorithmic performance by leveraging the end-user's domain expertise. An end-user installation method is proposed using \"stick on\" wireless object usage sensors. The method is then evaluated employing two in-situ, exploratory user studies, where volunteers live in a home fitted with an audio-visual monitoring system. Each participant was given a phone-based tool to help him or her self-install the object usage sensors. They each lived with the sensors for over a week. They were also asked to provide some training data on their everyday activities using multiple methods. Data collected from the two studies is used to qualitatively compare the end-user installation with two professional installation methods. Based on the two exploratory experiments, design guidelines for user self-installation of home sensors are proposed.",
