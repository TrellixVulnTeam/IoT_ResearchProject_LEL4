  abstract = {Inferring a gene regulatory network from time-series gene expression data is a fundamental problem in systems biology, and many methods have been proposed. However, most of them were not efficient in inferring regulatory relations involved by a large number of genes because they limited the number of regulatory genes or computed an approximated reliability of multivariate relations. Therefore, an improved method is needed to efficiently search more generalized and scalable regulatory relations.},
